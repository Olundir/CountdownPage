### Project done as part of the FrontEnd Mentor Challanges

## Focus of this project:

### Notes:

Card design:

- each card is doubled (top & bottom)
  1

  - top card is the one that will rotate in 3d axis (possibly have to make the lower part invisible somehow)
  - bottom card has to be visible only in the lower part (as a way to provide an ilusion of the card "breaking" in half when switching)
    2
  - top card has to be attached to the top part of 1
  - bottom one stays the same as 1 ?

- Indents: bottom one can have a permanent "mask" as for top ones it can be done similarly just going to be much harder
